## Decide on a story

Before you get coding, you'll need to decide on a story. Think about the story you want to tell. It could be:

+ A famous story
+ A story you have made up
+ Something that has happened to you or someone you know

It doesn't even have to be a story. It could be a joke, a poem, or anything else you want!
