Webpage content goes in the `<body>` section of the `index.html` HTML document.

+ `<h1>` is a **heading**. You can use the numbers 1 to 6 to create headings of different sizes.
+ `<div>` is short for **division**, and is a way of grouping stuff together. In this webpage, you'll use it to group together all the stuff for each part of your story.
+ `<img>` is an **image**.
+ `<p>` is a **paragraph** of text.
