Webpage content goes in the `<body>` section of the `index.html` HTML document.

+ Find the webpage content from line 7 onwards, inside `<body>` and `</body>` tags.

+ `<h1>` is a __heading__. You can use the numbers 1 to 6 to create headings of different sizes.
+ `<div>` is short for __division__, and is a way of grouping stuff together. In this webpage, you'll use it to group together all the stuff for each part of your story.
+ `<img>` is an __image__.
+ `<p>` is a __paragraph__ of text.
