Use what you've learnt in this project to finish telling your story! Here's an example:

![A cartoon with six panels in, each with part of a story](images/story-final.png)

Edit the HTML and CSS code to customise your webpage.

The HTML content can be found in the `index.html` file, and the CSS style in the `style.css` file.

You can also alter the colours used in the webpage, and you can use different fonts such as:
+ <span style="font-family: Arial;">Arial</span>
+ <span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS;">Comic Sans MS</span>
+ <span style="font-family: Impact;">Impact</span>
+ <span style="font-family: Tahoma;">Tahoma</span>
