## Editing your story

--- task ---
Before you get coding, you'll need to decide on a story. Think about the story you want to tell. It could be:

+ A famous story
+ A story you have made up
+ Something that has happened to you or someone you know

It doesn't even have to be a story. It could be a joke, a poem, or anything else you want!

Let's start by editing the HTML content and CSS style of the story's webpage.

+ Open [this trinket](http://jumpto.cc/web-story){:target="_blank"}.

The project should look like this:

Webpage content goes in the `<body>` section of the `index.html` HTML document.

+ Find the webpage content from line 7 onwards, inside `<body>` and `</body>` tags.

+ See if you can work out which tags are used to create the different parts of the webpage.

+ `<h1>` is a __heading__. You can use the numbers 1 to 6 to create headings of different sizes.
+ `<div>` is short for __division__, and is a way of grouping stuff together. In this webpage, you'll use it to group together all the stuff for each part of your story.
+ `<img>` is an __image__.
+ `<p>` is a __paragraph__ of text.
