## Finding your own images

Let's find an image on the web to add to your story.

+ Go to [this page](http://jumpto.cc/html-images){:target="_blank"}, and find an image that you want to include in your story.

+ Right-click the image, and click **Copy Image URL** (or **Copy Image Address**, depending on the computer you are using). The URL is the address of the image.
